# fy6900_upload
Minimal example to upload an arbitrary waveform to the FeelTech FY6900 DDS signal generator


This is largely included in two existing projects:
https://github.com/NikkiGirl/FY6xxx/blob/master/FY6xxx.py
https://github.com/ul5255/fy6800

But I wanted to have a minimal example to get quick and dirty code running.
